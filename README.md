# SecureWord - Healthcare-Focused Word Processor

A dual-mode word processor designed specifically for healthcare environments, offering both fast general-purpose editing and secure encrypted document handling.

## 🏥 Perfect for Healthcare Environments

**HR Pitch:**
*None of it would be used for electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI)
> "Our word processor can run in two modes: a strict privacy mode with secure logins and encryption — perfect for admin work; or a fast, light mode for general office use. Intuitive enough for anyone — from the front desk to clinical staff. I believe you shouldn't have to pay a subscription for something as simple as a word processor. No telemetry 'phoning home', no spammy ads, no privacy-wrecking analytics. A custom word processor designed for everyday workflow, with an option of privacy-first features ready if you need them."
✅ Strong Value Proposition
HIPAA-adjacent compliance (even if not ePHI)
Zero vendor lock-in (local files, no cloud dependency)
No subscription fees eating into clinic budgets
Privacy-first messaging resonates strongly in healthcare
✅ Real-World Use Cases
HR documents (employee reviews, disciplinary actions)
Financial planning documents
Vendor contracts and negotiations
Internal memos and policies
Meeting notes with sensitive discussions
✅ Competitive Advantage
Most word processors are either completely open OR completely locked down
The "Encrypted / Unencrypted modes" approach is unique and proides you encrypted documents with password required to veiw the document.
Healthcare market is underserved for simple, secure tools
