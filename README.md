## üõ°Ô∏è Security Notice

### Antivirus Detection
This application is **unsigned software**, which may trigger warnings from some antivirus programs. This is a common occurrence for new, independent software and does not indicate malicious content.

**Why this happens:**
- The application lacks a code signing certificate (expensive for individual developers)
- Some antivirus engines are overly cautious with unsigned executables
- This is a **false positive**, not actual malware

**What you can do:**
- Review the source code (this repository is open for inspection)
- Run the application in a sandboxed environment if concerned
- Check the file hash against releases to verify integrity

### Privacy Commitment
- **No telemetry** - Zero data collection
- **Local-only** - No network connections required for document processing
- **Open source approach** - Code available for security review
